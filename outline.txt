Solar System Simulation
-----------------------
Goals:
	- Simulate general solar systems
	- Start with just star and planets
	- n-body simulation
	- We want animations!

Tools:
	- git
	- python 
		- numpy, scipy, etc...
		- pygame
		- try to follow Google Style Guide

Immediate Tasks:
	- Look into different methods of doing n-body simulations
		- Trees
		- Particle Mesh

Design:
	- Input:
		- Store bodies as JSON files
		- Have code to compute important properties based on simpler input

	- Simulation:
		- Progress forward in time from start
		- Try to incorporate relativistic effects
		- Calculate forces, acceleration, velocity, positions at timesteps
			- Verlet method for integration

	- Graphics:
		- ???
		- Profit!
